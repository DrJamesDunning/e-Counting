# e-Counting
e-Counting is a 3-dimensional simulator of acoustic surveys developed for fisheries scientists interested in understanding, visualising, and developing the field of echo-counting. e-Counting provides tools to visualise virtual surveys in 3D, the record echograms, and compare estimated fish density with actual fish density.
